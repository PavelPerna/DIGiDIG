   ```bash
   make install
   docker compose up
   ```

2. **Production Deployment** (customize config):
   ```bash
   # Copy and edit production config
   cp config/config.prod.example.yaml config/config.prod.yaml
   # Edit config/config.prod.yaml with your values
   
   # Set environment
   export DIGIDIG_ENV=prod
   
   # Start services
   docker compose up
   ```

### CI/CD Automated Deployment

The project includes a complete CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment:

```bash
# Trigger staging deployment
git push origin main

# Trigger production deployment
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

**📖 See [CI/CD Pipeline Documentation](docs/CI-CD.md) for complete automation guide.**

### Health Monitoring

Check service health across environments:

```bash
# Local environment
./scripts/deployment/health-check.sh local

# Production with details
./scripts/deployment/health-check.sh production --details
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Management

**⚠️ YAML Configuration System**

Configuration uses YAML files instead of environment variables:

### Configuration Files

```
config/
├── config.yaml                 # Default (development) config
├── config.prod.example.yaml    # Production template
├── config.test.yaml            # Test environment
└── config.local.yaml           # Local overrides (git-ignored)
```

**Benefits over ENV variables:**
- ✅ Centralized configuration
- ✅ Hierarchical structure (YAML)
- ✅ Type safety (integers, booleans, lists)
- ✅ Better secrets management (separate files)
- ✅ Easy validation and documentation

See [Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) and [Migration Guide](docs/CONFIG-MIGRATION.md).

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Identity Service

The identity service has been updated to remove hardcoded admin credentials and improve security:

1. Admin User Creation
   - No more hardcoded admin credentials in the code
   - Admin user is now created via `identity/scripts/create_admin.py` during installation
   - Required environment variables:
     - `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Email for admin account
     - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Password for admin account
   - Example usage:

     ```bash
     ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure123 python3 scripts/create_admin.py
     ```

2. JWT Security
   - JWT tokens are used for authentication
   - The secret key can be customized via `JWT_SECRET` environment variable
   - Example in docker-compose.yml:

     ```yaml
     environment:
       - JWT_SECRET=your_secure_secret_here  # Change this in production!
     ```

3. Default Values & Security
   - The system includes fallback values for development, but all sensitive values should be overridden in production:
     - Database credentials
     - JWT secret
     - Admin credentials

### Database Security

1. PostgreSQL
   - Credentials configurable via environment variables:
     - `DB_USER`
     - `DB_PASS`
     - `DB_NAME`
     - `DB_HOST`
   - Default values are for development only

## Installation

These steps will set up the project with secure configuration:

1. Configure environment variables by creating `.env` file:

   ```env
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASS=your_db_password
   DB_NAME=your_db_name
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin@example.com
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_admin_password
   ```

1. Run the installation:

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

1. Start the services:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

## Security Best Practices

1. Always change default credentials in production
2. Use strong passwords and secrets
3. Keep environment variables secure and never commit them to version control
4. Regularly rotate JWT secrets and admin credentials

## Testing

DIGiDIG uses a **unified Docker testing system** for consistent test execution. All tests run in Docker containers with proper service networking.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Quick health check
make test-quick

# Configuration tests only
make test-config

# Show all available test categories
make test-help
```

### Available Test Categories

- **`make test-quick`** - Fast health check of all services
- **`make test-config`** - Configuration and service connectivity tests
- **`make test-unit`** - Unit tests for individual components  
- **`make test-integration`** - Full integration tests across services
- **`make test-identity`** - Identity service authentication tests
- **`make test-admin`** - Admin interface and management tests
- **`make test-flow`** - Complete email flow (SMTP → Storage → IMAP)
- **`make test-persistence`** - Database and storage persistence tests

### Test Infrastructure

- **Docker-based**: All tests run in containers with proper networking
- **Automated setup**: Services are started automatically if needed
- **Environment isolation**: Consistent test environment across machines
- **Comprehensive coverage**: 49+ tests covering all major functionality

📖 **See [Unified Docker Testing Guide](_doc/UNIFIED-DOCKER-TESTING.md) for complete documentation.**
  - External domain handling

### Test Structure

```

    ├── test_identity_integration.py  # Identity integration tests
    ├── test_identity_unit.py         # Identity unit tests
    └── test_smtp_imap_flow.py        # Email flow tests
```

### Test Results

Example test run:
```
✅ 9 passed in 3.90s
   - 2 Identity integration tests
   - 2 Identity unit tests
   - 5 SMTP/IMAP flow tests
⚠️  1 warning (deprecation in identity.py)
```

All tests run in isolated Docker container with access to service network.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

DIGiDIG includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions:

### Continuous Integration
- **Automated Testing**: Full test suite with PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- **Code Quality**: Black, isort, Flake8 validation
- **Security Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanning with GitHub Security integration

### Continuous Deployment
- **Docker Registry**: Automatic image builds and push to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- **Multi-Environment**: Staging (automatic) and production (manual approval) deployments
- **Health Checks**: Post-deployment validation with automatic rollback

### Container Images

All services are available as Docker images:

```bash
# Pull specific service
docker pull ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/digidig-identity:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/digidig-client:latest

# Available services: identity, storage, smtp, imap, client, admin, apidocs
```

### Deployment Automation
